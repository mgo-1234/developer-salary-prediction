# Developer Salary Prediction (Udacity ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a data version of the Stack Overflow survey.

Due to the large size of the original dataset, it is not included in this repository.

## 🔍 Dataset
- Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey https://survey.stackoverflow.co/
- Filtered to relevant features and cleaned for modeling

## 💡 Questions Explored
1. What factors most influence developer salary?
2. How well can we predict salary using machine learning?
3. What happens in a hypothetical prediction scenario?

## 🧪 Modeling Summary
- Model: Linear Regression (trained on 5,000 sampled rows)
- R² Score: `0.XX`
- MAE: `$XX,XXX`
