# Developer Salary Prediction (Udacity ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a filtered version of the Stack Overflow survey for reproducibility. Original data is available at the Stack Overflow website. To download the official dataset, visit Stack Overflow: https://survey.stackoverflow.co/datasets/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2024.zip


## 🔍 Dataset
- Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey https://survey.stackoverflow.co/
- Filtered to relevant features and cleaned for modeling

## 💡 Questions Explored
1. What factors most influence developer salary?
2. How well can we predict salary using machine learning?
3. What happens in a hypothetical prediction scenario?

## 🧪 Modeling Summary
- Model: Linear Regression (trained on 5,000 sampled rows)
- R² Score: `0.XX`
- MAE: `$XX,XXX`
